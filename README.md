Text Adventure for end of class
# A Text Adventure (Placeholder name, needs a creative title)

This is a fun project where the goal is to escape a dungeon. I've made several tiles to represent areas and explored Domain Specific Language to do it. You'll be able to move north, south, east, and west depending on where you're located. Each tile has either an enemy, gold, trader, or THE VICTORY! I am very happy to say that it is a project that I can iterate on as I get more comfortable coding. 

## Getting Started

The project runs via game.py, which is where the main function lives.

I added another element to the project which allows users to take their jpgs and turn them into ASCII versions. It's kind of like making abstract art for use in the terminal. Place your jpg into the Asciiart folder, run ascii.py, type the name of the image + .jpg (or .png, .jpeg, etc.) and hit enter. The program will put the ascii art into the terminal and create a .txt file in the ASCIIart folder. Every time you use a new image, that .txt file is overwritten. 

### Prerequisites

As long as you are using Python 3 - the version I used when writing this - you can run it.
