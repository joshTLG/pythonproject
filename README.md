Text Adventure for end of class
# A Text Adventure (Placeholder name, needs a creative title)

This is a fun project where the goal is to leave an area. I've made several tiles to represent areas. You'll be able to move north, south, east, and west depending on where you're located. Each tile has either an enemy, gold, trader, or victory.

## Getting Started

Just run the project in the terminal
