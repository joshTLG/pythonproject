Text Adventure for end of class
# A Text Adventure (Placeholder name, needs a creative title)

This is a fun project where the goal is to escape a dungeon. I've made several tiles to represent areas and explored Domain Specific Language to do it. You'll be able to move north, south, east, and west depending on where you're located. Each tile has either an enemy, gold, trader, or THE VICTORY! I am very happy to say that it is a project that I can iterate on as I get more comfortable coding. 

## Getting Started

The project runs via game.py, which is where the main function lives.

### Prerequisites

As long as you are using Python 3 - the version I used when writing this - you can run it. 

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The coding language used

## Authors
